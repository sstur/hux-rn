# Hux

Hux, an app for photo sharing. Built with React Native.

This project was part of a workshop at a tech conference in 2019 in which we explored building a Mobile App and a Web app with a single codebase.

The [backend for this app](https://github.com/sstur/hux-api) is built with Node + Prisma.

There is also a [version built in Flutter](https://github.com/sstur/hux-flutter).
